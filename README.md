About ViewCube
-----------

An addon for Blender (2.78+) which adds a ViewCube widget to the 3D View. This widget will act the same way AutoCAD's ViewCube widget acts, by allowing the user to click regions of the cube to set the camera perspective to that view.

Each region (Face, Corner, Edge) acts as a button, which when clicked, will rotate the camera (relative to the camera's existing view target) to the same orientation as the clicked region. 

For example:
- Top-Left-Front corner
- Front face,
- Front-Left edge
